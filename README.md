# Reinforcement-Learning-MABs

This repository contains the code and results for the Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) and reinforcement learning project. In this project, a few reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated, including EpsGreedy, UCB, LinUCB and KernalUCB. 

#### The project contains the following sections:

1. Implement Îµ-Greedy and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
2. Off-Policy Evaluation
3. Contextual Bandits
4. Evaluation
5. KernelUCB
